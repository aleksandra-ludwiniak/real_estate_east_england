# Price trends for all districts over the years


Below is an analysis of apartment prices on the primary and secondary markets for subsequent districts. In order to best compare prices and their changes between districts, charts were created for each district and then superimposed on one chart. Additionally, we used linear regression to check the average annual change for each district, which allowed us to predict the dynamics of changes in subsequent years.

The lines show a clear upward trend in prices over these two decades, indicating that houses in all districts have generally become more expensive over time. There is a clear decline in both markets around the crisis in 2008, but the overall trend is upwards. In the case of the secondary market, this growth is more stable, while in the primary market we have more sudden changes. It's clear that the Cambridge District has the highest median prices, but it's also the smallest area, which means the housing market there is very small.

# What about Fenland?

Our special attention was drawn to the Fenland district, where the median price of apartments on the primary market was the lowest in all recorded years and the growth rate was the lowest. However, on the secondary market, the median apartment price is no longer the lowest, and the growth dynamics examined using linear regression turned out to be higher than in the case of the Peterborough district. Buying a flat in Fenland may be a good investment if your budget is not the highest and you want to be the first owner of the property.

To investigate which months are the best to buy apartments in the Fenland district, we performed an analysis where, for each year, we checked in which quarter of a given year the median price was the highest and in which the lowest. For both markets, it is clearly visible that prices for most years were the highest in the fourth quarter and the lowest in the first quarter. We can conclude from this that it is best to buy properties in Fenland at the beginning of the year, when prices are lowest, and sell at the end of the year - however, bearing in mind the general strong upward trend year on year, it is best to simply buy as soon as possible, and in which quarter we do it in most likely doesn't matter.
