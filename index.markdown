title: Find the best investment on the housing market in the East of England
---

In recent years, the allure of the countryside has increasingly drawn attention from potential homeowners seeking tranquility away from the urban hustle. This trend has been particularly notable in East England, where picturesque landscapes blend with historical richness to offer a unique living experience. This project aims to leverage extensive data analysis to better understand the housing market dynamics in this region, providing valuable insights for individuals considering a move to the countryside.

The analysis encompasses a comprehensive exploration of house price trends and sales volumes over the past two decades, spanning from 1996 to 2015. By examining datasets on both existing homes and newly built properties, this study aims to capture a full spectrum of the market, offering insights into how prices have evolved and how many homes have been sold over time. Such knowledge is crucial, not only for potential buyers to make informed decisions but also for policymakers and developers to assess the impact of their initiatives and plan future developments effectively.

Using techniques ranging from basic statistical analysis to advanced predictive modeling, this project seeks to uncover patterns and correlations that define the housing market in East England's countryside. The ultimate goal is to provide a predictive outlook on housing prices, enabling prospective homeowners to anticipate market trends and make strategic decisions about when and where to purchase a property.

By focusing on this geographic area and market segment, this study addresses a significant gap in the available research, offering a targeted analysis that can help individuals and families better understand what to expect when considering a move to the countryside. Furthermore, this project not only aids buyers but also contributes to the broader dialogue about rural development and economic sustainability in East England.

# Price trends for all districts over the years


Below is an analysis of apartment prices on the primary and secondary markets for subsequent districts. In order to best compare prices and their changes between districts, charts were created for each district and then superimposed on one chart. Additionally, we used linear regression to check the average annual change for each district, which allowed us to predict the dynamics of changes in subsequent years.

The lines show a clear upward trend in prices over these two decades, indicating that houses in all districts have generally become more expensive over time. There is a clear decline in both markets around the crisis in 2008, but the overall trend is upwards. In the case of the secondary market, this growth is more stable, while in the primary market we have more sudden changes. It's clear that the Cambridge District has the highest median prices, but it's also the smallest area, which means the housing market there is very small.

# What about Fenland?

Our special attention was drawn to the Fenland district, where the median price of apartments on the primary market was the lowest in all recorded years and the growth rate was the lowest. However, on the secondary market, the median apartment price is no longer the lowest, and the growth dynamics examined using linear regression turned out to be higher than in the case of the Peterborough district. Buying a flat in Fenland may be a good investment if your budget is not the highest and you want to be the first owner of the property.

To investigate which months are the best to buy apartments in the Fenland district, we performed an analysis where, for each year, we checked in which quarter of a given year the median price was the highest and in which the lowest. For both markets, it is clearly visible that prices for most years were the highest in the fourth quarter and the lowest in the first quarter. We can conclude from this that it is best to buy properties in Fenland at the beginning of the year, when prices are lowest, and sell at the end of the year - however, bearing in mind the general strong upward trend year on year, it is best to simply buy as soon as possible, and in which quarter we do it in most likely doesn't matter.
